# Examining_Gemma_2_2B_discrimination
Code, data, and logical solutions used during the work on my thesis. Everyone interested in examining similar issues is encouraged to modify and implement them on their own. The code and data allow for the replication and conduct of the entire experiment by itself. The goal was to check whether Gemma 2 2B is discriminatory and, if so, towards whom?
